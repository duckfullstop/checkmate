# Playdeck

The _Playdeck_ package implements a set of utilities for working with standard, 52-card decks of playing cards.


## Why is this a package?

I've split this into its own package in the hopes that other applications that may
need to work with playing cards / decks of cards can easily extend from this one (perhaps even yours!).

The _blackjack_ package makes direct use of this one - see over there for more details.
