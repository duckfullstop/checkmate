# test

_test_ is an internal package that simply holds integration and functional test cases proving
that this solution passes the original requirements set out in the brief.

A lot of tests here duplicate those already in the packages - 
I've chosen to rewrite them here to succinctly prove the functionality originally requested is present and correct.
